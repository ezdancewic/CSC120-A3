Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Nicole Choi, who is in section 2 of CSC-120. Because she was in a different section, she was drawing off of a slightly different version of the GuessingGame example, and we ended up implementing different approaches to defining the scanners and getting the initial inputs. This was super helpful because we were able to help each other without having the exact same code and I ended up understanding both why her method worked and why mine did. I also consulted Emily Middleton who is in Section 1. We helped each other debug our MirrorWord functions and she helped me realize why doing the whole thing with if statements was gonna be logistically messy. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to TA hours on Thursday, Sept 19th 8-9, Sunday Sept 22nd 2-3, and Monday Sept 23rd 7-9. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's not too bad. Still not used to some of the syntax, and its hard to wrap my head around object oriented programming, but I'm getting there. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Programming in general has some pretty universal concepts (for loops & iteration, conditionals, types, logical sequences), but each language deals with their syntax and how the data are stored differently. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I felt that it was incredibly necessary to go to TA hours on this assignment (perhaps to the point that I needed them too much). I could understand how to do the mirror words conceptually, and write out the code for it, but if I got an error I couldn't figure out on my own, or needed to know some specific method, it felt like I *couldn't* make progress until I got help from a TA. Generally though, it was extremely helpful to discuss this assignment with my peers. I would recommend future students to map out their code on paper if they get a response they don't expect.
